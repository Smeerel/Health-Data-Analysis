# Health-Data-Analysis
# Introduction:
This repository provides an overview of the Health Data Analysis project conducted using Python.Analyzing appointment no-show data in the context of healthcare can provide valuable insights into patient behavior, scheduling efficiency, and opportunities for improvement.EDA analysis was done to gain some important insights related to missed appointments and suggest future actions to reduce appointment no-shows.
# Dataset:
- The dataset used in this project is related to a Healthcare Organization.
- It consists of information specifically related to patientâ€™s appointment booking and other patient details such as age, gender, medical conditions, etc.


# Content:
Dataset, EDA Notebook and Powerpoint Presentation.

# Project Overview:
In this project, we analyze Healthcare data to gain insights into the factors that contribute to missed appointments. Python is used for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to gain insights related to factors leading to no-shows and provide actionable recommendations for reducing appointments being missed by the patients.

# To run the analysis, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis notebooks)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
  
[Optional] Other libraries based on the analysis requirements.
# Analysis:
The analysis involves the following steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data's characteristics, exploring relationships between variables by performing both Univariate and Bivariate Analysis, and identifying potential patterns.
- Interpretation: Interpreting the analysis's results and identifying key factors contributing to no-shows.

# Results:
The results of the analysis will include:

- Visualizations illustrating key findings from the EDA.
= Insights into factors influencing no show ups on appointment day.
- Recommendations for reducing missed appointments.
